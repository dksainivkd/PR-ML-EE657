# Pattern recongition and Machine Learning.
Assignment 1 :- Implemented Bayes Decision Criterion Classifier for Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits
Dataset (UCI respiratory) taking different types of covariance matrices. Also performed different degrees of 
polynomial regression on data set.

Assignment 2 :- Built decision tree to classify data from the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset
and regression tree to classify data set based on Capital Bike Sharing (CBS) system.
